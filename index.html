<p>hi im 2Shyfeet</p>
<p>i have another account with 1 song under 2Shy<b>F</b>eet</p>
<p>that song has been stuck in Distrokid's review process for a few months for making the edit change from 2ShyFeet to 2Shyfeet</p>
<p>this is my site, do i really need to make another instagram and twitter that ill never use?</p>
<p>i would never have done this if i knew it would be so difficult to complete</p>
<p>can you just accept my artist profile as 2Shyfeet? i will delete 2ShyFeet when the song has been transfered so I can fiaallly move forwatf with my life</p>
